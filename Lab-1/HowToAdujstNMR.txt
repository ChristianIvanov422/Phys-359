HOW TO ADJUST NMR?

- RF probe
	*
	* 
	*

- 90/180 tunning
	* maximize CH1 by changing A_len
	* double A_len to get 180
	* Minimize CH1 using fine tuning capacitor
	* Minimize CH1 by changing A_len
	* Repeat last 2 steps until reaching the minimum
	* divide by 2 A_len to get 90
	* Adjust the frequency to smooth CH2

- Magnet temperature
	* adujst to have off leds.
	* close both magnets switches.

- Magnetic gradients adjustment
	* play with the gradients to maximize the decay time.
